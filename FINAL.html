              The NBA is a league in constant change.

                With each era, a different type of player seems to become more or less valuable. In a time where versatility and two-way players are among the most valuable in the league, wings stand to make more money than ever. Teams have even already started demonstrating just how much they value these types of players.

              Just this last season, the Toronto Raptors reportedly received an offer of three first round picks for defensive wing OG Anunoby, Anthony Edwards signed an extension worth over $200 million, Desmond Bane got close to it as well.

               The best way to demonstrate the value these players command is the money they make.

            <p class="paragraph">
               During the last ten years, the money wing players make has grown with the increases to the Salary Cap. Based on the salary and the Cap, it is fair to infer that some players might be commanding a higher percentage of the funds a team has any given season. Given that wings seem to be so valuable in the modern game, these players might be gaining more of a team’s funds every year.

               For this exercise, a wing was described as a player that can play in the perimeter and is between the heights of 6’4” and 6’9”. Some divisive players were included in the list such as Bradley Beal, James Harden and CJ McCollum, while others, such as Ben Simmons, were not included. The logic behind these decisions comes from the number of minutes the respective players had at different positions. Defensive assignments were not considered as part of the rubric.

              The past chart demonstrates the ten best paid wings of the NBA for the last ten seasons. The data shows how the money these players made incremented from Danny Granger in 2014, to Pascal Siakam in 2023. Both were the tenth highest paid win in their respective seasons, but the difference is close to $20,00,000.

            <p class="paragraph">
              Despite an early outlier in 2014, in large part due to Kobe Bryant’s contract, the rest of the decade has seen a steady incline regarding the money wings earn. The money reached its peak in 2023, where the average salary was $39,000,000.

              Contrary to initial belief, the clear rise in money is not correlated to a potential rise in value for these athletes. The visual representation clearly shows that the average percentage of the cap these players make has not really changed and is not even currently at its highest point.   
            </p>

<section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
              Actually, there are three seasons where wings made a higher percentage of the cap on average than in 2022-2023. This makes the most recent NBA season closer to average than the top.  
            </p>

 <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
              If this is the case for wings, there is a potential chance that the same happened for guards and big men in the NBA. Despite some indications pointing to an increase in pay percentage, teams seem not to be increasing the resources they invest into these players; leading to the question: which really is the most valuable position in the NBA?
            </p>

    <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
              Moving forward, it will be interesting to see how this may change in the next decade. With stars like Jayson Tatum, Brown, Edwards, Scottie Barnes, Brandon Ingram, or Jalen Green looking to earn some hefty salaries, these numbers might be changing after all.
