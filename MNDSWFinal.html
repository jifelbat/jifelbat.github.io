She waits 10 minutes, 15, 20 – her husband is eventually a half hour late. This is not uncommon in the Smith household; Aaron’s work sometimes requires him to do more than expected.

                Aaron had to pick up students from the team so they could compete, their parents could not take them or pick them up afterwards. He regularly drives the students from their houses to meets, and back. It adds an extra hour worth of time to his already busy day, but he is happy to be there for the students. He is happy to see them compete.

                Aaron Smith, track coach and gym teacher at OnTECH Charter High School, wants to be a supportive figure for inner-city student-athletes who wish to continue pursuing athletics past high school. With his support, Smith wants to show these children that they can continue on this path without having to worry about most things inner-city kids are worrying about.

                “I was one of those kids that I really didn't have anybody supporting me in my sports,” Smith said. Still, Smith graduated high school and continued his track and field career into college. He felt proud of what he accomplished, but wanted to help future students who were in his position. 
            </p>

<section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                “There's kids that I saw after I graduated that don't have the opportunity to go to training camps or combines,” Smith said. “They don't know that they have to send out footage of himself to colleges so that they can be seen.”

                Gloria Smith, Aaron’s wife, said his wish to work with inner-city kids and his paternal instinct with the children comes from his own experiences. Aaron Smith grew up without a father for most of his childhood. His mother married when he was 12 years old, but the two came from different backgrounds and Aaron’s stepfather was not active in terms of supporting his sports participation. 
            </p>

<section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                Smith said he also received limited support from people at his school, which was common growing up. This forced him to become his own biggest supporter. He appreciates what his family did and the ways they tried to support, but he knows he could have gone farther with the right support.  
            </p>

<section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                “He understands what's at stake for a lot of these kids and knowing that he can make the difference drives him,” Gloria said. “He knows that there's too much at stake for him to say he doesn't care.”
            </p>

<section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                “A lot of these inner-city kids, not everybody has a two-parent household. A lot of these kids don't have those positive father role models. He's able to be that kind of consistent, masculine energy that a lot of these children need,” Gloria said. Smith tries to develop healthy relationships with all his students based on consistency and discipline.
            </p>

<section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                Smith’s relationship with his students is the foundation for his career. He wants to be a father figure for the children who pass through his teams or classes. Moreover, he wants to create an athletic center where any inner-city kid can focus on developing their craft and receive all the education they need regarding the process of athletics past high school. 
            </p>

    <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                This project would be the culmination of all the elements Smith wishes to emphasize in his work. It would be a consistent space for the children to grow as athletes without having to worry about outside noise. It would also give the children the parental, supportive figure some of them don’t have. 
            </p>

    <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                Smith’s program would offer students dedicated coaches to guide them through their development, counselors to help them send papers and videos to colleges, mentors who understand the process and can offer advice, tutors to make sure they keep grades above the required levels to earn an opportunity, psychologists to help with the burdens kids are taking on and social workers to help students with behavioral problems.
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                “It would target kids in the city that would be great athletes, but they have other things that are stopping them from being so; whether it's they're trying to help support their families or working instead of doing sports, or they are there just a school that that doesn't favor every kid,” Smith said. “They just need somewhere to play.”
            </p>

         <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                Theodore Jones, athletic director at OnTECH, said his understanding of their situation and attempts at relating with them makes him almost an older brother. 
            </p>

         <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                “A lot of our kids are very comfortable with talking to him about their problems, their issues going on, he helps them level through it,” Jones said. “(Students) may not feel like they're being heard, or maybe need a different perspective, you know?”
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                Jones added that Smith also tries to make sure he keeps tabs on all students one-on-one, their eating habits and situation before meets. He also tries to replicate the one-on-one dynamic during practices. OnTECH track practices have two parts: first the team warms up and works on some drills together, then they separate in groups and focus on their specific events. Smith tries to go around the practice and have an individual conversation with everyone. He looks at their work and effort, identifies where they might be struggling, and gives them input that will help their specific problem. 
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                For Jones, this type of individual approach showcases what truly makes Smith valuable to the school: his ability and wish to connect with his students and athletes. However, what makes Smith stand out is his character and tendency to hold students accountable. 
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                Smith has a strict code; guidelines students are expected to follow. He does not allow profanity, unexcused absences, disrespecting teachers or cutting class. If he catches students doing any of these, it's 20 push-ups. Repeat offenders are required to do more. Students are not forced to complete the punishment, Smith can’t force them to do so, but students do so either way. 
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                “They have that respect and love for him, so they do it,” Jones said. “They're glad to do it. They understand it's not that they're just going to be goofy, that's holding them accountable.”
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                Jones remembered a specific case of a student who has grown during his time under Smith. Jazz is a senior who first met Smith as a sophomore. Jazz gave Smith trouble at first, gave him pushback and did not allow OnTECH teachers to connect with him. Gloria Smith categorized him as the kind of student you’d be afraid to have represent the school.
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                His time under Smith allowed him to grow as both a student and person. Jazz joined the school’s football team, a collaboration with Bishop Grimes, and both were present for the last game. 
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                “Just the politeness that's there now. Like, he would greet me and the way they respect (Smith) and play around with him at the same time. At the Bishop Grimes games… he was able to interact with the other parents and kids, and they all loved him,” Gloria Smith said. “He was just so well behaved and polite; you would actually trust him to represent the school at that point.”
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                She added that Jazz even took on a leadership role by making sure other teammates behaved appropriately and avoided cursing. His overall outlook in life has changed too, as his grades have improved and he’s now looking at Smith’s own alma mater as an option for a bachelor's degree. 
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                Gloria believes this level of respect mostly comes from Smith’s personality. 
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                “I think people just kind of naturally gravitate toward him. He can be that really great shoulder to cry on, but he's also somebody who will come up with a solution and help you through it,” Gloria said. 
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                Jones considers Smith his right-hand man. “He's my department,” Jones said of Smith’s role. 
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                Contractually, Smith can’t be called assistant athletic director, but he still assists Jones in every facet of his work. Jones said he shares everything he does with Smith for input. He feels that the best outcome for students will come if the two work together.
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                Smith’s input has allowed the school to develop plans, establish priorities, ask for budget and better mold the young program to the students. Smith helped write the school’s athletic handbook and wrote their student behavior contract himself. He also helps the athletic director keep track of all student-athletes and their schoolwork. OnTECH did not even have an athletic program before Smith joined the team. 
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                “I like to call him my assistant athletic director, I just would love for him to be paid for his duties,” Jones said. “Without him, I don't think I would be as successful as I've been so far.”
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                Smith is proud to work at OnTECH and help the children, but his work at the school is just a step for him to accomplish his dream. 
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                The athletic center Smith wants to create would take him years to develop and he still needs to get more experience under his belt. He needs to keep meeting coaches, learn what inner-city kids would need from him, learn how Section III Athletics work, make connections with other schools and colleges and build a reputation. 
            </p>
        
        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
                It’s a long process, but Smith is passionate about his mission and willing to stick with it.
