              This decision has led to confusion for graduate students, as they look for more concrete direction from the school. For starters, graduate students want more liberty from the university to explore AI in their classes.

              Out of the 18 graduate students who selected they would support AI in the classroom, more than half pointed ChatGPT out as an exception. Despite ChatGPT being the most popular AI tool students can use for their classes, students do not seem to support it.
