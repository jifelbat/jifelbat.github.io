<p>With many children having breaks off from school and parents from work, the holidays are the perfect moment for family reunions and friendly gatherings. Moreover, with people starting to get over the COVID-19 pandemic, more and more families organize big gatherings to celebrate Christmas and New Year's, among others. </p>
<p> However, with more people gathering in increasingly bigger groups without concern for the pandemic, the danger of contracting the virus grew. Numbers released by the State of New York indicate that this was the case, as COVID-19 cases grew during the holiday break.</p>
<p>According to the State of New York, the number of COVID-19 tests taken in the months of January and February 2021, were significantly higher than those in November and December of 2020. Moreover, positive cases also increased, as did the rate of positive tests. </p>

<p>The past chart compares the number of tests taken, positive cases, and the rate of positive cases for the final months of 2020 and the first months of 2021. After New Year's, cases went up in all of New York.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, cases started going down again during the first half of 2021. </p>

<p>Potentially due to the return to "normal life", COVID-19 cases incrementally decreased throughout the months following the holidays. The past chart demonstrates how positive cases decreased in both New York City and the rest of the state. </p>
<p>Other potential reasons as to why these numbers went down include the people of New York increasingly forgetting about the pandemic or deciding COVID-19 is not worth testing anymore. In order to define this, there must be more data gathered during and following the 2021 holidays in order to compare results. </p>
